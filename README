    The `gitinfo2' package allows version control metadata to be
incorporated into LaTeX documents; the metadata is obtained from the
git distributed version control system.
    For `memoir' users, the package provides additional page styles
(headers and footers) with selected metadata.

    gitinfo2 is licenced under the LPPL. For more details,
please see the accompanying manual: gitinfo2.pdf.
